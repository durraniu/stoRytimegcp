## About

If you want to run this app on your own, you'd need an account ID and generate an API key on Cloudflare Workers AI to use their models API. The API is free to use for models in beta. After you obtain the ID and API key, clone this repo and add create a `.Renviron` file in the root of the cloned repo. Add the ID and key to the environment file. Now you are ready to run this app with `golem::run_dev()`or `storytimegcp::run_app()`.
